            <p>
                This server is a casual server for the giga-est of chads focusing on mostly QoL mods.
                The idea is that it puts less stress on the players that are new to modded, while giving older players
                a refreshed Valheim experience.

            <p>
                There are a few great launchers that make it easy to add mods, such as <a href="https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/">r2modman</a>, which is what we use.

            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <p class="question">Q: Are there any world modifiers?</p>
            <p class="answer">A: We're playing in immersive mode, so no portals and no map aside from a mod that enables it in the cartography table (this feature should be in the base game imo). Combat is set to hard but the death penalty is reduced. </p>
            <p class="question">Q: Can I have the world seed?</p>
            <p class="answer">A: No. We're playing Immersive mode, so that kind of defeats the point.</p>
