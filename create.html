            <h2>Using Minecraft With Mods</h2>
            <p>Fear not, for it is not hard with the right launcher.</p>
            <p>
                We recommend you download and familiarize yourself with <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">Prism Launcher</a>, as it is very versatile, 
                lightweight, and stable. You may use another more user-friendly launcher if you like, such as the CurseForge Launcher, or the Default launcher. 
                However, pack development is much simpler with Prism Launcher, so we use it by default.
            </p>
            <p>
	            Please ask in the <a href="https://discord.gg/mychN9rg6c">Discord</a> if you need help with setting up the modded launchers.
